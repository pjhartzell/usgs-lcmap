      <abstract>The Land Change Monitoring Assessment and Projection (LCMAP) raster dataset is a suite of five annual land surface change and five annual land cover (and land cover derivative) products.  The LCMAP approach is the foundation for an integrated land change science framework led by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). The data were calculated using the Continuous Change Detection and Classification (CCDC) algorithm developed by Zhu and Woodcock (2014) and are derived from a time series of satellite imagery consisting of all available cloud- and shadow-free pixels in the USGS Landsat Analysis Ready Data (ARD) archive (Dwyer and others, 2018). The CCDC methodology supports the continuous tracking and characterization of changes in land cover, and condition enabling assessments of current, historical, and future processes of change. 
Landsat ARD, as the source data for LCMAP, are standardized Landsat data pre-processed to ensure the data meet a minimum set of requirements and are organized into a form that allows immediate analysis with a minimum of additional user effort. ARD data are provided as tiled, georegistered, surface reflectance products defined in a common equal area projection and tiled to a common grid. ARD observations must be transformed into time series vectors before further calculations using the CCDC methodology. 
The CCDC methodology, initially developed at Boston University (Zhu and Woodcock, 2014), has been adopted and modified by USGS for LCMAP. CCDC involves harmonic modeling that characterizes the seasonality, trends, and breaks from those trends based on the time series spectral reflectance data from multiple Landsat bands (i.e., green, red, near-infrared, short-wave infrared). The CCDC approach involves two major components: change detection and classification. The change detection component utilizes available high-quality surface reflectance data in a pixel-based time series to calculate a mathematical model for the spectral response of each pixel and to estimate the dates at which the spectral time series data diverge from past responses or patterns. The basis of change detection is the comparison of clear satellite observations with model predictions.  'Divergence' (referred to as a model 'break') often is identified as the result of an abrupt change (e.g. wildfire, logging, mining, and urban development) but may also result from a gradual shift (e.g., forest regrowth, insect infestation, disease) in the spectral signal over time. Breaks are detected by CCDC by applying a criterion based on the root mean square error of the harmonic modeling. Time periods for established models are referred to as 'model segments.' After a break is identified in the time series, a new model can be established following the break provided there are enough clear observations going forward in time. 
The classification component of CCDC involves using the coefficients of time series models as the inputs for land cover classification. The CCDC method has the capability to generate land cover for any date in the time series; the USGS has selected an annual time step for land cover classification. The suite of land cover and change products are nominally identified at a central point in the year, July 1. Classification is performed using a boosted decision tree method based on training data developed from Coastal Change Analysis Program (C-CAP) for 2010/2011 (NOAA, 2015), 2001 National Land Cover Database (NLCD; Homer et al., 2014), LANDFIRE 2010 (LF 1.2.0, 2013) Existing Vegetation Type (EVT) for Hawaii, Hawaii Statewide Agricultural Land Use Baseline 2015 (Melrose et al., 2016), National Wetlands Inventory (NWI) produced by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS, 2020), and Gridded Soil Survey Geographic (gSSURGO) Database for Hawaii (USDA, 2020). The land cover legend for the Primary and Secondary Land Cover products is comparable to an Anderson level 1 classifcation scheme.</abstract>

        <procdesc>Continuous Change Detection. Landsat ARD surface reflectance (SR), brightness temperature (BT), and PixelQA data are retrieved through LCMAP data access services for the date range 2000-01-01 through 2021-01-01 (exclusive) from the LCMAP Information Warehouse and Data Store (IWDS). These data are then processed by the LCMAP implementation of the Continuous Change Detection component of the CCDC algorithm, with results stored back in the LCMAP IWDS. The full list of observation dates from ARD used for processing through Continuous Change Detection is available in the separate file LCMAP_HI_000000_20211130_V10_ACQS.txt</procdesc>

        <procdesc>Classification: Training Labels. A set of rules was used to define the inclusion and crosswalking of training labels for pixels within the LCMAP mapping area. Two source datasets, the C-CAP land cover and LANDFIRE EVT product, are first crosswalked to an equivalent NLCD land cover class. Pixels mapped as developed (open space or low/medium/high intensity) in all of the following products: NLCD 2001 land cover, C-CAP 2010/2011 land cover, and LANDFIRE 2010 EVT, with the resulting extent eroded by one pixel are called developed. Pixels mapped as pasture/hay in both NLCD 2001 and C-CAP 2010/2011 and not mapped as developed in LANDFIRE 2010 EVT; or, pixels mapped as cultivated crops in C-CAP 2010/2011 and not mapped as developed by NLCD 2001 or LANDFIRE 2010 EVT are called cropland. Pixels mapped as shrub/scrub in C-CAP 2010/2011, not mapped as developed, pasture/hay, or cultivated crops in NLCD 2001, not mapped as developed in LANDFIRE 2010 EVT, and not mapped as evergreen forest in both NLCD 2001 and LANDFIRE 2010 EVT; or, pixels mapped as grassland/herbaceous in C-CAP 2010/2011, not mapped as pasture/hay, cultivated crops, or developed in NLCD 2001, and not mapped as developed in LANDFIRE 2010 EVT; or, pixels mapped as shrub/scrub or grassland/herbaceous in NLCD 2001, pasture/hay in C-CAP 2010/2011, not covered by agricultural footprints (except pasture) in the 2015 Statewide Agricultural Land Use Baseline, and not mapped as developed in the LANDFIRE 2010 EVT are called grass/shrub. Pixels mapped as evergreen forest in C-CAP 2010/2011, not mapped as developed in NLCD 2001 or LANDFIRE 2010 EVT, and not mapped as shrub/scrub or grassland/herbaceous in both NLCD 2001 and LANDFIRE 2010 EVT; or, pixels mapped as woody wetland in C-CAP 2010/2011, as evergreen forest by both NLCD 2001 and LANDFIRE 2010 EVT, and having a gSSURGO PWSL value of 0 are called tree cover. Pixels mapped as open water in C-CAP 2010/2011 are called water. Pixels mapped as woody or emergent herbaceous wetlands in NLCD 2001 and C-CAP 2010/2011, and covered by NWI footprints, and not mapped as developed in LANDFIRE 2010 EVT; alternatively, pixels mapped as woody wetlands in C-CAP 2010/2011, covered by NWI footprints, not mapped as developed by NLCD 2001 or LANDFIRE 2010 EVT, and having a gSSURGO PWSL value between 50 and 999 are called wetland. Pixels mapped as barren land (rock/sand/clay) in all of the following products: NLCD 2001 land cover, C-CAP 2010/2011 land cover, and LANDFIRE 2010 EVT are called barren.</procdesc>

        <procdesc>Classification: Ancillary Prep. Ancillary data is comprises of USGS 3DEP 1-arc-second DEM for Hawaii, and a wetland layer derived from rasterized NWI freshwater wetland extent. Three calculated DEM derivative values (topographic slope, aspect, and position index) are also supplied as ancillary data. Slope was calculated using the maximum change in elevation between the pixel in question and the eight surrounding pixels, expressed as a continuous variable (0–90 degrees). The aspect layer identifies the downslope direction of the maximum rate of change in topographic elevation. These values indicate the compass direction that the sloped surface is facing at that pixel location. Aspect is expressed as a categorical value, with values that range from 1–16 and represent clockwise degrees from north, in intervals of 22.5 degrees (i.e., a value of 1 indicates a downslope direction of 0–22.5 degrees from north). Flat areas have no downslope direction and are given a value of –1. Position index is an indicator of the topographic context of a pixel (hilltop, valley bottom, exposed ridge, flat plain, upper or lower slope, etc.).</procdesc>

        <procdesc>Classification: Training. Continuous Change Detection, NWI, Digital Elevation Model (DEM), DEM derived (slope, aspect, and position index), and the derived training layer are assembled for each tile and the 8 surrounding tiles for classification model training. These data are selected based on two criteria: 1) a stable time series segment which intersects the date 2010-07-01 and 2) a valid training label available. These data are then randomly sampled stratified by class. The intercepts from the change detection data are transformed into a predicted value of overall reflectance for 2010-07-01. The data are then processed by XGBoost for training, with the resulting model being stored back in the LCMAP IWDS.</procdesc>

        <procdesc>Classification: Prediction. Change detection results, NWI, digital elevation model (DEM) data and derivatives (slope, aspect, and position index), and the trained classifier are retrieved from the LCMAP IWDS. For each July 1st that a time series model crosses, the intercept values from the time series model are replaced with a predicted overall reflectance, and then processed by the classifier.</procdesc>

        <procdesc>Product Generation: Change detection and classification information are assembled for a specific tile. Data are then interpreted into 10 annual Land Cover/Land Change products. The complete CCDC time series model for a pixel is made up of one or more individual temporal model segments, which allows for continuous characterization of that pixel at any point in time. Time of Spectral Change and Change Magnitude are based on the calendar year, while the other 8 products are created by intersecting an annual July 1st date with the CCDC time series models. 2000 was demonstrated to be the year when ARD data density reached a sufficient level for derived time series models to provide consistent patterns and results could be generated. The end of the time series often lacks adequate information to determine if an existing model segment is stable or is in the process of changing. Therefore, the final year of the time series and products is considered provisional.</procdesc>
